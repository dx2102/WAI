      Notes (Metacognitive reflection):
    </p>
    <!--division line-->
    <div-line></div-line>
    <p>
      Professor Kendrick, 
      I have made a small website for Assignment 3!
      (I think you can also skip this reflection part 
      and go down first.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to mention some technical details first.
      I had spent about two weeks in the winter break
        learning some basic web development skills before.
      This is actually not too hard for me.
      There are many tutorials online, and 
      most concepts like fonts and colors 
      are just the same as in Microsoft Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenAI released the "API interface" of ChatGPT a few months ago. 
      That is to say, I can communicate with the OpenAI server through
      simple programs in this website.
      However, I am not sure whether 
      this will work properly.
      Of course there must be some bugs...
      If you find any bugs or things don't work,
      I am very sorry.
    </p>    
    <p>
      About the target audience,
      I think one of the big advantange
      of the internet is its openness.

      I have uploaded this web page 
      to the free server of Github Pages.
      In theory, everyone on the Internet 
      can read this article.
      (They can probably find this article
      in search engines if they search very hard. 
      Although there may not be 
      a lot of people checking this website for now, 
      maybe I will improve this website someday.
      It is just not sure.)
      Web pages can also be more attractive
      and easier to find, compared to essays.

      Therefore, I think I can say that
      everyone with access to the Internet
      is potentially my audience.
      In other words, any random people
      who happened to have clicked in 
      will be my target audience.

      Correspondingly, I try to keep my language 
      as short as possible so that 
      readers can get to the point of the site 
      (as many other sites do)

      I do not want to formally exclude
      any kind of people from my audience.
      Just like other technology progress in the past,
      in some way, the changes in AI 
      will be related to most people 
      in some way in the future.

    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of format and purpose, 
      for this radical revision of WAI Assignment 2,
      I will take advantange of the format of web page,
      and make a 
      "Strange Gallery of ChatGPT" in this website.
      Bubeck et al. (2023) showed me 
      in their article that
      there are many hidden potentials 
      (also hidden weaknesses) inside ChatGPT.
      It is usually hard to immediately 
      see these potentials with the 
      ChatGPT official chat website interface.
      I will try to emulate some of his examples in this webpage.
      I will include screenshots of ChatGPT,
      or try to embed ChatGPT into this website.
      However, I do not have access to GPT-4 
      in this website, so I will only use 
      the ordinary GPT-3.5 version of ChatGPT.
    </p>
    <p>
      About my purpose in this article,
      my first purpose is to 
      have a simple experiment with ChatGPT myself,
      and possibly inspire people to discuss
      and think more about Artificial Intelligence.
      In this way, we can have a first-hand 
      understanding of in what sense is  
      the current language model "intelligent".
      Although to completely understand something,
      just doing experiments are not enough at all,
      I nonetheless think this is a great first step.
    </p>
    <p>
      My second purpose is that,
      I am simply just curious what kind of 
      visual products can ChatGPT produce.
      It can be very interesting.
    </p>

  <p>
    In my last essay (essay 2),
    I discussed the debate about whether
    AGI (Artificial general intelligence)
    is possible. 
    
    I concluded that, 
    large language models like GPT-4
    can already do such a wide range of tasks,
    that it's not a problem to say that 
    their intelligence is general.

    On the other hand, these models 
    "think" in a very different way
    from humans.
    Just like airplanes and birds both fly,
    but they have very different principles.

    As I was finding and reading essays
    to prepare for assignment 2, 
    I found the essay of Bubeck et al. (2023)
    more and more interesting.
    They published an article entitled 
    "Sparks of Artificial Intelligence" 
    Later, Bubeck also went to MIT
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIk7-JPB2c">
      gave a presentation about this essay (2023).
    </a>
    
    Bubeck made an interesting point in his speech. 
    Usually when testing a machine learning model, 
    people use some machine learning test set. 
    For example, 1,000 multiple-choice questions 
    on general knowledge of science 
    can be counted as the test set. 
    People then feed these questions to the model 
    and measure the accuracy of the model's answers. 
    But Bubeck said, "We're actually moving from 
    machine learning to psychology... 
    I don't want to use the machine learning test set. 
    My assumption is that GPT-4 
    has seen any text on the Internet, 
    including those tests... 
    What we have to do is be creative 
    and ask it some questions 
    that have never appeared on the Internet."
  </span>



  <div-line></div-line>


  <p>
    Bubeck's words made perfect sense for me.
    When we can not understand something thoroughly,
    the first thing we can do is to experiment with it.
    One of the most interesting example
    that Bubeck gave in his presentation,
    is to ask GPT-4 to generate 
    SVG code of a unicorn.
    SVG means "Scalable Vector Graphics".
    It is a text format to 
    define some 2d shape or image
    with coordinates.
    For example, 
    rect x="50" y="160" width="10" height="20" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"
    the code like this will draw a rectange with the given
    xy coordinates, size, and colors on the screen.
    Just like rectangles, you can also draw 
    segments, polygons, circles, and so on in svg.
    When I imitated Bubeck and asked ChatGPT to 
    "draw" a unicorn, here is its result.
    (I am just using ChatGPT but 
    Bubeck is using GPT-4, so the result may be different.
    Also, I did try a few time to get the best result.)

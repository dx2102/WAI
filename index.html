      Notes (Metacognitive reflection):
    </p>
    <!--division line-->
    <div-line></div-line>
    <p>
      Professor Kendrick,
      I have made a small website for Assignment 3!
      (I think you can also skip this reflection part
      and go down first.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to mention some technical details first.
      I had spent about two weeks in the winter break
      learning some basic web development skills before.
      This is actually not too hard for me.
      There are many tutorials online, and
      most concepts like fonts and colors
      are just the same as in Microsoft Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenAI released the "API interface" of ChatGPT a few months ago.
      That is to say, I can communicate with the OpenAI server through
      simple programs in this website.
      However, I am not sure whether
      this will work properly.
      Of course there must be some bugs...
      If you find any bugs or things don't work,
      I am very sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the target audience,
      I think one of the big advantange
      of the internet is its openness.

      I have uploaded this web page
      to the free server of Github Pages.
      In theory, everyone on the Internet
      can read this article.
      (They can probably find this article
      in search engines if they search very hard.
      Although there may not be
      a lot of people checking this website for now,
      maybe I will improve this website someday.
      It is just not sure.)
      Web pages can also be more attractive
      and easier to find, compared to essays.

      Therefore, I think I can say that
      everyone with access to the Internet
      is potentially my audience.
      In other words, any random people
      who happened to have clicked in
      will be my target audience.

      Correspondingly, I try to keep my language
      as short as possible so that
      readers can get to the point of the site
      (as many other sites do)

      I do not want to formally exclude
      any kind of people from my audience.
      Just like other technology progress in the past,
      in some way, the changes in AI
      will be related to most people
      in some way in the future.

    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of format and purpose,
      for this radical revision of WAI Assignment 2,
      I will take advantange of the format of web page,
      and make a
      "Strange Gallery of ChatGPT" in this website.
      Bubeck et al. (2023) showed me
      in their article that
      there are many hidden potentials
      (also hidden weaknesses) inside ChatGPT.
      It is usually hard to immediately
      see these potentials with the
      ChatGPT official chat website interface.
      I will try to emulate some of his examples in this webpage.
      I will include screenshots of ChatGPT,
      or try to embed ChatGPT into this website.
      However, I do not have access to GPT-4
      in this website, so I will only use
      the ordinary GPT-3.5 version of ChatGPT.
    </p>
    <p>
      About my purpose in this article,
      my first purpose is to
      have a simple experiment with ChatGPT myself,
      and possibly inspire people to discuss
      and think more about Artificial Intelligence.
      In this way, we can have a first-hand
      understanding of in what sense is
      the current language model "intelligent".
      Although to completely understand something,
      just doing experiments are not enough at all,
      I nonetheless think this is a great first step.
    </p>
    <p>
      My second purpose is that,
      I am simply just curious what kind of
      visual products can ChatGPT produce.
      It can be very interesting.
    </p>

    In my last essay (essay 2),
    I discussed the debate about whether
    AGI (Artificial general intelligence)
    is possible.

    I concluded that,
    large language models like GPT-4
    can already do such a wide range of tasks,
    that it's not a problem to say that
    their intelligence is general.

    On the other hand, these models
    "think" in a very different way
    from humans.
    Just like airplanes and birds both fly,
    but they have very different principles.
    (Deming, 2022)
  </p>

  <span>
    As I was finding and reading essays
    to prepare for assignment 2,
    I found the essay of Bubeck et al. (2023)
    more and more interesting.
    They published an article entitled
    "Sparks of Artificial Intelligence"
    Later, Bubeck also went to MIT
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIk7-JPB2c">
      gave a presentation about this essay (2023).
    </a>

    Bubeck made an interesting point in his speech.
    Usually when testing a machine learning model,
    people use some machine learning test set.
    For example, 1,000 multiple-choice questions
    on general knowledge of science
    can be counted as the test set.
    People then feed these questions to the model
    and measure the accuracy of the model's answers.
    But Bubeck said, "We're actually moving from
    machine learning to psychology...
    I don't want to use the machine learning test set.
    My assumption is that GPT-4
    has seen any text on the Internet,
    including those tests...
    What we have to do is be creative
    and ask it some questions
    that have never appeared on the Internet."
  </span>



  <div-line></div-line>

  <p>
    Bubeck's words made perfect sense for me.
    When we can not understand something thoroughly,
    the first thing we can do is 
    to experiment with it.
    Even if the conclusion may be 
    misleading sometimes.
    One of the most interesting example
    that Bubeck gave in his presentation,
    is to ask GPT-4 to generate
    ".svg" code of a unicorn.
    "SVG" means "Scalable Vector Graphics".
    It is a text format to
    define some 2d shape or image
    with coordinates.
    For example,
    &lt;rect x="50" y="110" width="100" height="50"&gt;

    the code like this will draw a rectange with the given
    xy coordinates, size, and colors on the screen.
    Just like rectangles, you can also draw
    segments, polygons, circles, and so on in svg.
    When I imitated Bubeck and asked ChatGPT to
    "draw" a unicorn, here is its result.
    We can turn svg code into a real image
    by putting them into a website
    or put them into an editor called CodePen.
    
    (I am just using ChatGPT but
    Bubeck is using GPT-4, so the result may be different.
    Also, I did try a few time to get the best result.)

  <p>
    According to Bubeck (2023), 
    the ability of ChatGPT to write svg code 
    shows a few things.
    First, ChatGPT is good at using other tools
    based on text, and in psychology,
    the ability of humans 
    to use tools is important.
    Besides using svg to draw,
    we can also tell ChatGPT to 
    write codes,
    and actually run those codes.

    Bubeck also showed a few other examples 
    in the presentation.
    For example, if we give ChatGPT 
    a calculator, it will do a lot better in calculation.
    Also, if we connect ChatGPT to
    other text-to-image AI drawer, 
    ChatGPT will be able to provide
    detailed descriptions of the image
    so that the AI drawer can draw better.
  </p>

  <p>
    Secondly, according to Bubeck (2023),
    this shows that 
    ChatGPT has some basic sense of space and world.
    ChatGPT is a language model,
    and it has only seen text and codes.
    It has never seen real images before.
    However, it can still draw a unicorn
    with most of the parts in the right place.
    Bubeck also showed example of ChatGPT
    "drawing" a map of a game
    based on the description it was given.
    For Bubeck, the point of this question is that,
    drawing a unicorn with SVG
    is a unique question that has never been asked
    on the Internet. 
    Therefore it will require 
    the real ability of ChatGPT.
    Therefore, ChatGPT will not be 
    This means that some ideas of space
    hidden inside the text 
    are also understood by ChatGPT.
    
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us observe
    the unicorn and cherry blossom tree images 
    that that I got from ChatGPT
    with more details.
    First, these images are not perfect.
    Many images have disconnected parts.
    In fact, the unicorn image that I have
    shown is originally like this:
  </p>

  
  <svg width="20vw" height="20vw" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <!-- Body -->
    <rect x="50" y="110" width="100" height="50" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
    
    <!-- Head -->
    <circle cx="100" cy="80" r="30" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
    
    <!-- Horn -->
    <polygon points="100,55 95,70 105,70" fill="gold" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
    
    <!-- Legs -->
    <rect x="60" y="160" width="20" height="30" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
    <rect x="120" y="160" width="20" height="30" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
    <rect x="50" y="160" width="10" height="20" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
    <rect x="140" y="160" width="10" height="20" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  </svg>

  <p>
    But after the right hint,
    ChatGPT fixed the issue.
    According to Bubeck (2023),
    this can also count as a simple 
    kind of reflection.
  </p>

  <p>
    Secondly, ChatGPT generally 
    knows the spacial relationship 
    between parts.
    It knows that legs should be under
    the body and 
    be connected to the four corners of the body,
    and so on.
  </p>


  <p>
    And this is the end of this web page.
    We have discussed the sense of space,
    tool using, simple self-reflection,
    and simple creativity of ChatGPT
    mentioned by Bubeck (2023) in his speech,
    and examined them with some detailed examples.
    I think these types of approaches 
    will be a good way to understand AIs.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
    Finally, I will provide here a 
    real textbox and button 
    to generate more svgs 
    in real time from ChatGPT.
    In my experience,
    I actually feel that ChatGPT
    sometimes yields results that seems
    quite inspiring and creative.
    I will use the "ChatGPT API" provided by OpenAI.
    I am only allowed to have 3 messages per minute,
    and I am not sure whether this will work successfully.

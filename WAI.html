      Professor Kendrick, 
      I have made a small website for Assignment 3!
      I want to mention some technical details first.
      I had spent about two weeks in the winter break
        learning some basic web development skills before.
      This is actually not too hard for me.
      There are many tutorials online, and 
      most concepts like fonts and colors 
      are just the same as in Microsoft Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenAI released the "API interface" of ChatGPT a few months ago. 
      That is to say, I can communicate with the OpenAI server through
      simple programs in this website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there must be some bugs...
      If you find any bugs or things don't work,
      I am very sorry.
    </p>

    In this radical revision of WAI Assignment 2,
    I will take advantange of the format of web page.
    I will insert more multi-media contents, 
    including screenshots of ChatGPT.
    I also embed ChatGPT into this website,
    to show some hidden ability of ChatGPT,
    which is usually unseen 
    in the ChatGPT official website.
    With these multi-media contents,
    we can have a first-hand 
    understanding of 
    exactly in what sense is  
    the current language model "intelligent".
  </span>

  <p>
    I have uploaded this web page 
    to the free server of Github Pages.
    In theory, everyone on the Internet 
    can read this article.
    Webpage can also be more attractive
    and easier to find compared to essays.
    I hope that in this way,
    this article can potentially have a larger audience.
  </p>

    In my last WAI Assignment,
    I discussed the debate about whether
    AGI (Artificial general intelligence)
    is possible. 
    
    I concluded that, 
    large language models like GPT-4
    can already do such a wide range of tasks,
    that it's not a problem to say that 
    their intelligence is general.

    On the other hand, these models 
    "think" in a very different way
    from humans.
    Just like airplanes and birds both fly,
    but they have very different principles.

    As I was reading the essay for assignment 2, 
    I found the essay of Bubeck et al. (2023)
    more and more interesting.
    They published an article entitled 
    "Sparks of Artificial Intelligence" 
    Later, Bubeck also went to MIT
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIk7-JPB2c">
      gave a presentation about this essay (2023).
    </a>
    
    Bubeck made an interesting point in his speech. Usually when testing a machine learning model, people use some machine learning test set. For example, 1,000 multiple-choice questions on general knowledge of science can be counted as the test set. People then feed these questions to the model and measure the accuracy of the model's answers. But Bubeck said, "We're actually moving from machine learning to psychology... I don't want to use the machine learning test set. My assumption is that GPT-4 has seen any text on the Internet, including those tests... . What we have to do is be creative and ask it some questions that have never appeared on the Internet."
